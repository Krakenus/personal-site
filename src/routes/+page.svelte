<h1>About me</h1>

<p class="mb-2">Hi! let me introduce myself.</p>
<p class="mb-2">My name is Milan and I'm a software developer from Czech Republic.</p>
<p class="mb-2">I met computers for the first time when I was 4. Since then I'm intrigued by technologies, computers, programming and also a little bit of IOT and electronics.</p>
<p class="mb-2">Most of my activities are connected with <a class="underline hover:text-gray-600" rel="external noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.coex.cz/en/">COex</a> company where I participate on many interesting projects as a backend developer. From time to time I also do freelance work or my own projects.</p>
<p class="mb-2">When I don't work I love spending my time by trying new technologies, reading books, listening to music and playing computer games.</p>
<p class="mb-2">And last but not least I'm proud father of an incredibly smart little girl. ðŸ™‚</p>
